//! Cooperative scheduler — Milestone A5, [T-004].
//!
//! Design settled in [ADR-0019] (queue structure, yield semantics,
//! blocked-task representation, IPC bridge ownership). Generic over
//! `C: ContextSwitch` per [ADR-0020].
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! - [`SchedQueue<N>`] — bounded FIFO of [`TaskHandle`]s.
//! - [`TaskState`] — per-task state enum (`Idle / Ready / Blocked`).
//! - [`Scheduler<C>`] — ready queue, per-task state, saved contexts, and
//!   the identity of the currently running task.
//!
//! The IPC bridge (`ipc_send_and_yield` / `ipc_recv_and_yield`) is an
//! orchestration layer on top of [`crate::ipc`]; the IPC module itself
//! remains ignorant of scheduling concerns.

// ─── Raw-pointer bridge (ADR-0021) ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The three entry points below replace the former `&mut self` methods
// `Scheduler::yield_now`, `Scheduler::ipc_send_and_yield`, and
// `Scheduler::ipc_recv_and_yield`. They take `*mut Scheduler<C>` plus raw
// pointers to any external shared state (arenas, queues, capability tables)
// so that *no* `&mut` reference to any of those referents is alive across
// `cpu.context_switch`. Momentary `&mut` references are materialised only
// inside narrow inner `unsafe` blocks that end strictly before a switch or
// begin strictly after a switch returns. See [ADR-0021] for the full
// contract and the reasoning.
//
// # Shared safety contract
//
// Every function in this block has the same caller-facing contract. Stating
// it once here and referring to it from each function keeps each body focused
// on its own logic.
//
// - **Pointer validity.** Every `*mut T` pointer passed in must be non-null,
//   properly aligned for `T`, and point at a valid, exclusively-owned `T`.
//   "Exclusively-owned" here follows v1's single-core cooperative invariant:
//   no two tasks ever run simultaneously, so at any given instant only one
//   task is executing and thus only one dereference site is live. When a task
//   is suspended mid-bridge, its stack frame holds only raw pointers (never a
//   `&mut`), so the other task is free to re-derive its own raw pointers
//   from the same `UnsafeCell` interiors with no aliasing hazard.
// - **Non-aliasing across the switch.** No `&mut` reference to `Scheduler<C>`,
//   `EndpointArena`, `IpcQueues`, or `CapabilityTable` may be alive across
//   `cpu.context_switch`. Each bridge function honours this by confining
//   `&mut` materialisation to an inner `unsafe` block that ends before the
//   switch call site. This is a **global** invariant: when a task is
//   suspended mid-bridge, no other kernel path may hold a `&mut` to the
//   same referent. The single-core cooperative model satisfies this because
//   the only concurrent "path" is the task that just resumed via
//   `cpu.context_switch`, and its own bridge call re-derives raw pointers
//   from the same `UnsafeCell` interiors without ever materialising an
//   overlapping `&mut`.
// - **Distinct task indices.** The internal split-borrow on
//   `(*sched).contexts[current_idx]` vs `contexts[next_idx]` is sound because
//   the scheduler never enqueues the running task twice; the two indices are
//   therefore distinct, as already audited under UNSAFE-2026-0008.
// - **Interrupts disabled.** An [`IrqGuard`] is held for the duration of the
//   context-switch call; the guard is constructed before the switch and
//   dropped on return.
