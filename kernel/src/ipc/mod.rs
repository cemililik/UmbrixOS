//! IPC subsystem — Milestone A4 / [T-003][t003].
//!
//! Implements the three IPC primitives settled in [ADR-0017][adr-0017]:
//!
//! - [`ipc_send`] — synchronous rendezvous send on an [`Endpoint`].
//! - [`ipc_recv`] — synchronous rendezvous receive on an [`Endpoint`].
//! - [`ipc_notify`] — non-blocking bit-OR into a [`Notification`].
//!
//! ## Waiter-state design
//!
//! Each `Endpoint` can be in one of four states (see [`EndpointState`]):
//!
//! ```text
//! Idle ──send──► SendPending   (message + optional cap waiting for receiver)
//! Idle ──recv──► RecvWaiting   (receiver registered; no sender yet)
//! RecvWaiting ──send──► RecvComplete  (sender delivered to waiting receiver)
//! RecvComplete ──recv──► Idle         (receiver picks up the delivery)
//! SendPending  ──recv──► Idle         (receiver drains the pending send)
//! ```
//!
//! This state lives in [`IpcQueues`], not inside the [`Endpoint`] struct,
//! to avoid a circular module dependency: `cap` imports from `obj` for the
//! typed handles; putting `Capability` in `obj::Endpoint` would require `obj`
//! to import from `cap`, creating a cycle.
//!
//! ## Capability transfer
//!
//! When `ipc_send` is called with a non-`None` transfer handle, the capability
//! is extracted from the sender's table via [`CapabilityTable::cap_take`] and
//! stored in the endpoint's waiter state. On the matching `ipc_recv`, the
//! capability is installed into the receiver's table via
//! [`CapabilityTable::insert_root`]. Between these two calls, the capability is
//! owned by the endpoint state — not by any table.
//!
//! ## A4 scope note
//!
//! Phase A4 has no running scheduler. "Blocking" means recording the pending
//! state in the endpoint; the A5 scheduler will drain waiter queues when it
//! schedules tasks. `ipc_notify` sets bits on the notification word; waiter
//! wakeup is wired in A5.

    //
    // `IpcQueues::reset_if_stale_generation` (used by `state_of` /
    // `peek_state`) protects the slot-reuse path. When a new endpoint is
    // allocated in a slot whose previous occupant has been destroyed, the
    // queue's recorded `slot_generations[idx]` lags behind the new
    // handle's generation. The function detects the mismatch, asserts —
    // in debug — that the prior state did not leave a `Some(cap)` behind
    // (which would be silently dropped here, since the function holds no
    // capability table), and resets the slot to `Idle`.
    //
    // The pair below covers both halves of the contract:
    //   1. SendPending { cap: Some(_) } with a stale generation must
    //      panic so the leak is loud.
    //   2. RecvWaiting (no cap) with a stale generation must reset
    //      silently — proving the assert's predicate is not over-broad.
    // Both tests reach reset_if_stale_generation via `peek_state` (a
    // public-to-the-module method that calls it as the first step), so
    // the production path is exercised, not a local copy.
