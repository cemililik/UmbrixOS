//! Kernel-object subsystem.
//!
//! Every capability points at a kernel object. This module owns the
//! object types ([`Task`], [`Endpoint`], [`Notification`]), their typed
//! handles ([`TaskHandle`], [`EndpointHandle`], [`NotificationHandle`]),
//! their per-type arenas, and the create / destroy APIs that produce
//! and consume them.
//!
//! The storage shape is pinned in [ADR-0016][adr-0016]: per-type
//! fixed-size-block arenas, generation-tagged typed handles, global
//! ownership, zero `unsafe`. Rationale is unchanged from the capability
//! table ([ADR-0014][adr-0014]); [`Arena`] is the audited pattern
//! generalised and instantiated three times.
//!
//! [adr-0014]: https://github.com/cemililik/TyrneOS/blob/main/docs/decisions/0014-capability-representation.md
//! [adr-0016]: https://github.com/cemililik/TyrneOS/blob/main/docs/decisions/0016-kernel-object-storage.md
//!
//! ## Status (v1, T-002)
//!
//! - Three kinds: [`Task`], [`Endpoint`], [`Notification`]. `MemoryRegion`
//!   is deferred to Phase B.
//! - Typed handles prevent cross-kind confusion at compile time.
//! - Lifecycle is explicit destruction; a reachability check against a
//!   given set of capability tables is available through
//!   [`crate::cap::CapabilityTable::references_object`] but is *not*
//!   automatically performed by the destroy functions. Callers that
//!   need the check wire it in at their call site; a successor ADR will
//!   bundle it when the kernel owns a registry of tables.
//! - All v1 kernel-object code is safe Rust.
