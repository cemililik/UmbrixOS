///   [`IrqGuard`]) are layered on top, not into the trait.

/// Construct with [`IrqGuard::new`] to enter a critical section. The

/// in place rather than fully re-enabling interrupts.
///
/// Generic over the concrete CPU type `C` to avoid fat-pointer vtable
/// dispatch on critical-section paths. Dynamic dispatch (`&dyn Cpu`) is also

/// running at — it lets callers avoid duplicating the inline-asm `MRS`
/// pattern from one site to another.
///
/// Free function rather than a [`Cpu`] trait method per ADR-0024
/// §Open questions: the early-boot path (between `_start` and
/// `kernel_entry`) needs to read the EL before any `Cpu` instance has
/// been constructed, so the helper must be callable without a `&self`
/// receiver. Test mocks (e.g. the `FakeCpu` instances in
/// [`tyrne_test_hal`] and the kernel's `sched` test module) therefore
/// do not need to declare an EL of their own.
///
/// # Availability
///
/// Defined only on `target_arch = "aarch64"` AND `target_os = "none"`
/// (i.e. the bare-metal kernel build). On hosted targets — including
/// `aarch64-apple-darwin` running unit tests, where `CurrentEL` reads
/// would trap with a `SIGILL` because user code is not in EL1 — the
/// function is intentionally absent. Host tests must mock the EL
/// rather than call this helper.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `MRS x, CurrentEL` is a non-privileged read of a read-only system
/// register. It is callable at every EL ≥ 0, does not modify any
/// state, and `options(nostack, nomem)` is correct — there is no
/// stack-pointer touch and no memory access. The function presents
/// itself as `safe` because it upholds those invariants and returns a
/// plain `u8`.
///
/// **Why `unsafe` is required:** there is no Rust intrinsic, `core`
/// API, or stable safe primitive that exposes the `CurrentEL` system
/// register; inline assembly is the only available primitive for this
/// read on aarch64. Pulling a third-party crate (`aarch64-cpu` or
/// similar) for a single MRS is disproportionate per the project's
/// dependency policy. Audit: UNSAFE-2026-0018.
