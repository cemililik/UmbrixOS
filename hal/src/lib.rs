//! # umbrix-hal
//!
//! Trait surface that decouples the Umbrix kernel core from any specific CPU,
//! board, or peripheral. Concrete implementations live in per-board Board
//! Support Package crates named `umbrix-bsp-*`.
//!
//! This crate defines **traits only**. It contains no logic, no implementations,
//! and no hardware addresses. See [`docs/architecture/hal.md`][hal-doc] for the
//! full responsibilities of each trait and [ADR-0006][adr-0006] for the
//! crate-boundary rationale.
//!
//! [hal-doc]: https://github.com/cemililik/UmbrixOS/blob/main/docs/architecture/hal.md
//! [adr-0006]: https://github.com/cemililik/UmbrixOS/blob/main/docs/decisions/0006-workspace-layout.md
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! In progress. Traits are pinned down one at a time, each behind a dedicated
//! ADR. Accepted so far: [`Console`] (ADR-0007). The remaining trait stubs
//! below are placeholders whose method surfaces will be pinned by their own
//! ADRs at Phase 4b implementation time.

/// Privileged CPU state and control.
///
/// Implementations are architecture-specific (aarch64 for the initial BSPs;
/// RISC-V planned). Responsibilities: core identification, CPU-level interrupt
/// masking, wait-for-interrupt, context-switch primitives, memory barriers
/// that Rust's atomics do not cover, and secondary-core start via `PSCI` or
/// an architecturally equivalent mechanism.
///
/// Final method signatures to be settled in a dedicated ADR at Phase 4b
/// implementation time.
pub trait Cpu {}

/// Memory management unit interaction.
///
/// Responsibilities: translation-table activation, entry installation and
/// removal, `TLB` invalidation (per-`ASID`, global, per-address), and the
/// cache maintenance sequences the architecture requires between page-table
/// writes and `MMU` reads.
///
/// Memory allocation for page tables is not the HAL's job — the kernel owns
/// a physical-frame allocator and hands the HAL frames to fill in.
pub trait Mmu {}

/// Interrupt controller dispatch and control.
///
/// Responsibilities: enable and disable specific `IRQ` lines, acknowledge
/// the current `IRQ` at entry, end-of-interrupt signalling, and optional
/// per-CPU routing.
///
/// Used by the kernel's minimal interrupt service routine. Drivers never see
/// this interface; they receive asynchronous notifications on their
/// `IrqCap`'s endpoint.
pub trait IrqController {}

/// Monotonic time and deadline arming.
///
/// Responsibilities: report nanoseconds since boot (monotonic, never goes
/// backwards across suspend), arm a one-shot deadline that arrives as an
/// `IRQ`, and cancel a deadline.
pub trait Timer {}

/// System `IOMMU` interaction, on platforms that have one.
///
/// Scopes a peripheral's `DMA` to the regions granted to its driver. On
/// platforms without an `IOMMU` (for example, Raspberry Pi 4), this trait is
/// absent from the BSP or implemented as a no-op per the BSP's explicit
/// design. See
/// [`docs/architecture/security-model.md`][sec-doc] for the trust-boundary
/// implications.
