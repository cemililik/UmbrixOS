/// Monotonic time source and one-shot deadline support.
///
/// Covers the single-core primitives the kernel needs to read current time
/// and to schedule a wake-up as an interrupt. Per-core timers, periodic
/// APIs, and alternate clock sources are out of scope in v1 and will
/// arrive through their own ADRs.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// - **Object-safe.** The kernel uses `&dyn Timer`.
/// - **`Send + Sync`.** Compiler-enforced; the same `Timer` may be
///   referenced from any online core.
/// - **No allocation.** Implementations must not touch the heap.
/// - **Nanoseconds as the unit.** All four methods exchange `u64`
///   nanoseconds; mixing units at the HAL boundary is a bug.
/// - **Absolute deadlines.** `arm_deadline` takes the target time, not
///   a delay. Callers who want relative delays compute
///   `now_ns() + delay`.
/// - **Single armed deadline.** At most one deadline is pending; arming a
///   second replaces the first. Software multiplexing of many deadlines
///   is the scheduler's responsibility.
/// - **Past deadlines fire promptly.** Arming a deadline in the past
///   must not be silently dropped; the IRQ fires as soon as the hardware
///   can deliver it.
pub trait Timer: Send + Sync {
    /// Return nanoseconds elapsed since boot.
    ///
    /// Monotonic: never goes backwards. 64 bits are enough for ~584 years
    /// of runtime.
    fn now_ns(&self) -> u64;

    /// Arm a one-shot deadline at the given absolute time.
    ///
    /// When [`Timer::now_ns`] reaches or exceeds `deadline_ns`, an IRQ
    /// fires on the timer's interrupt line. Arming replaces any
    /// previously-armed deadline.

// ─── Tick-frequency arithmetic helpers ────────────────────────────────────────

// Pure, host-testable utilities used by any [`Timer`] implementation that
// is backed by a free-running counter at a known frequency in Hz (the ARM
// Generic Timer, x86 TSC + invariant-TSC frequency, RISC-V `time` CSR,
// etc.). They live in `tyrne-hal` rather than in any single BSP because
// the arithmetic is identical across all such implementations and unit
// tests can exercise it without inline assembly.

/// Nanoseconds in one second. Lifted to a named const so call sites read
/// as intent rather than as a magic literal.
pub const NANOS_PER_SECOND: u64 = 1_000_000_000;

/// Convert counter ticks to nanoseconds, given the counter's frequency in Hz.
///
/// Uses 128-bit intermediate arithmetic so the multiplication is overflow-
/// free for any tick count up to `u64::MAX` and any sane frequency
/// (≥ 1 Hz). The cast back to `u64` is **saturating**, not wrapping:
/// extreme inputs return `u64::MAX` rather than wrapping to a small value.
/// This preserves the `Timer::now_ns` monotonicity contract — at the rare
/// extreme where elapsed nanoseconds exceed `u64::MAX` (~584 years),
/// `now_ns` plateaus at `u64::MAX` instead of wrapping to zero.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics with a named message if `frequency_hz == 0`. BSP impls should
/// validate the frequency at construction (e.g. by reading `CNTFRQ_EL0`
/// and asserting non-zero) so the panic is unreachable in production —
/// but the explicit `assert!` here ensures the contract is honoured even
/// if a caller forgets, rather than degrading to an implicit
/// divide-by-zero (which produces an unfriendly compile-time error in
/// const context and an unfriendly runtime error otherwise).
