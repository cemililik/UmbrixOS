//! `Cpu`, `ContextSwitch`, and `Timer` implementations for the QEMU `virt`
//! aarch64 target.
//!
//! `QemuVirtCpu` implements:
//! - [`tyrne_hal::Cpu`] — interrupt masking and core identity (object-safe).
//! - [`tyrne_hal::ContextSwitch`] — cooperative register-state save/restore
//!   (generic; see [ADR-0020]).
//! - [`tyrne_hal::Timer`] — monotonic time via the ARM Generic Timer's
//!   **virtual** counter (`CNTVCT_EL0`) and frequency register
//!   (`CNTFRQ_EL0`); see [ADR-0010]. The deadline-arming half
//!   (`arm_deadline` / `cancel_deadline`) is intentionally
//!   `unimplemented!()` until GIC + interrupt-vector-table wiring lands —
//!   see T-009 task notes. Reading the virtual counter (rather than the
//!   physical `CNTPCT_EL0`) keeps the read side aligned with the
//!   deferred deadline-arming side, which programs `CNTV_CVAL_EL0` /
//!   `CNTV_CTL_EL0` per ADR-0010's references and ADR-0022's first-
//!   rider sub-rider.
//!
//! # Safety overview
//!
//! The context-switch assembly (`context_switch_asm`) is the only intrinsically

        // (CNTPCT) so the read side and the deferred deadline-arming side
        // (`CNTV_CVAL_EL0` / `CNTV_CTL_EL0`, see ADR-0010 references and
        // ADR-0022's first-rider sub-rider) live in the same register
        // family. On QEMU virt with `CNTVOFF_EL2 = 0` the two counters
        // coincide; using CNTVCT preserves correctness when a future boot
        // path leaves a non-zero offset.

        // EL access: per ADR-0012 / ADR-0024, `boot.s` drives the kernel
        // to EL1 (transitioning from EL2 if the firmware/emulator
        // delivered there). The runtime assertion in `QemuVirtCpu::new`
        // (`tyrne_hal::cpu::current_el() == 1`, audited under
        // UNSAFE-2026-0018 / UNSAFE-2026-0016 Amendment) guarantees we
        // are at EL1 by the time this method ever runs. At EL1 in the
        // non-VHE configuration the kernel runs in
        // (`HCR_EL2.{E2H, TGE} = {0, 0}`, written explicitly in `boot.s`
        // per UNSAFE-2026-0017), CNTVCT_EL0 is unconditionally readable
        // — the `CNTHCTL_EL2.EL1VCTEN` gating that exists in VHE mode
        // does not apply here. The instruction does not modify any
        // state; `options(nostack, nomem)` is correct.
        //
        // Rejected alternatives:
        // (a) Read `CNTPCT_EL0` (physical) instead — rejected during
        //     T-009's second-read review per ADR-0010's register-family
        //     mandate; would silently mismatch the deferred deadline-
        //     arming side once `CNTVOFF_EL2 ≠ 0`.
        // (b) No safe-Rust way to read a system register; the `Timer`
        //     trait is the safe abstraction wrapping this MRS.
        // (c) A higher-level crate (`cortex-a` / `aarch64-cpu`) would
        //     pull a dependency for one MRS — disproportionate per the
