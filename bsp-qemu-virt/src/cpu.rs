//! `Cpu`, `ContextSwitch`, and `Timer` implementations for the QEMU `virt`
//! aarch64 target.
//!
//! `QemuVirtCpu` implements:
//! - [`tyrne_hal::Cpu`] — interrupt masking and core identity (object-safe).
//! - [`tyrne_hal::ContextSwitch`] — cooperative register-state save/restore
//!   (generic; see [ADR-0020]).
//! - [`tyrne_hal::Timer`] — monotonic time via the ARM Generic Timer's
//!   `CNTPCT_EL0` / `CNTFRQ_EL0` system registers (see [ADR-0010]). The
//!   deadline-arming half (`arm_deadline` / `cancel_deadline`) is
//!   intentionally `unimplemented!()` until GIC + interrupt-vector-table
//!   wiring lands — see T-009 task notes.
//!
//! # Safety overview
//!
//! The context-switch assembly (`context_switch_asm`) is the only intrinsically
//! unsafe operation in this file. Every other `unsafe impl` is a marker that
//! follows from the struct's invariants, and every inline-asm system-register
//! read is a non-mutating MRS at EL1. See the individual `// SAFETY:` comments
//! and the audit entries `UNSAFE-2026-0006` through `UNSAFE-2026-0009`, plus
