//! `Cpu`, `ContextSwitch`, and `Timer` implementations for the QEMU `virt`
//! aarch64 target.
//!
//! `QemuVirtCpu` implements:
//! - [`tyrne_hal::Cpu`] — interrupt masking and core identity (object-safe).
//! - [`tyrne_hal::ContextSwitch`] — cooperative register-state save/restore
//!   (generic; see [ADR-0020]).
//! - [`tyrne_hal::Timer`] — monotonic time via the ARM Generic Timer's
//!   **virtual** counter (`CNTVCT_EL0`) and frequency register
//!   (`CNTFRQ_EL0`); see [ADR-0010]. The deadline-arming half
//!   (`arm_deadline` / `cancel_deadline`) is intentionally
//!   `unimplemented!()` until GIC + interrupt-vector-table wiring lands —
//!   see T-009 task notes. Reading the virtual counter (rather than the
//!   physical `CNTPCT_EL0`) keeps the read side aligned with the
//!   deferred deadline-arming side, which programs `CNTV_CVAL_EL0` /
//!   `CNTV_CTL_EL0` per ADR-0010's references and ADR-0022's first-
//!   rider sub-rider.
//!
//! # Safety overview

//! The context-switch assembly (`context_switch_asm`) is the only intrinsically
