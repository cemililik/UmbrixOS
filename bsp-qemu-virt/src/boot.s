/*
 * QEMU virt aarch64 reset entry.
 *
 * See docs/decisions/0012-boot-flow-qemu-virt.md, ADR-0024 (EL drop
 * to EL1 policy), and docs/architecture/boot.md for the design.
 *
 * Responsibilities, in order:
 *   1. K3-12: mask all interrupts (DAIF) at the very head of _start
 *      so the reset vector cannot accidentally take an interrupt
 *      before the kernel installs a vector table. (BSP boot-checklist
 *      rule; per ADR-0024 dependency chain item.)
 *   2. EL drop to EL1 per ADR-0024:
 *        - If CurrentEL is EL2 (e.g. -machine virtualization=on, or
 *          most real-hardware boot stacks delivering at EL2),
 *          configure HCR_EL2 (RW=1 so EL1 runs aarch64; E2H=0,
 *          TGE=0 — explicitly non-VHE per ADR-0024), set SPSR_EL2 =
 *          EL1h with DAIF masked, set ELR_EL2 to the post_eret label,
 *          and ERET.
 *        - If CurrentEL is EL1 (QEMU virt's default), skip the drop.
 *        - If CurrentEL is EL3 (or any other unexpected value), halt
 *          in the named-label `wfe`-loop (`halt_unsupported_el: wfe ;
 *          b halt_unsupported_el`). v1 has no EL3-aware infrastructure;
 *          ADR-0024 §Open questions tracks the future EL3→EL2→EL1
 *          chain for hardware that requires it.
 *   3. Set the stack pointer to __stack_top (from linker.ld).
 *   4. Enable FP/SIMD at EL1: set CPACR_EL1.FPEN = 0b11 so that the
 *      compiler-generated NEON instructions (e.g. movi/stp q-regs for
 *      zero-initialisation) do not trap as Undefined Instruction.
 *   5. Zero the BSS region [__bss_start, __bss_end), which is 8-byte
 *      aligned at both ends so 8-byte stores are safe.
 *   6. Branch to kernel_entry (a Rust function marked extern "C").
 *   7. If kernel_entry ever returns (it should not), halt defensively.
 *
 * After step 2, every later instruction runs at EL1 regardless of
 * the entry EL — the precondition T-009's UNSAFE-2026-0016 runtime
 * `CurrentEL == 1` self-check in QemuVirtCpu::new now relies on as a
 * load-bearing invariant rather than a defensive guard.
 *
 * Audit: UNSAFE-2026-0017.
