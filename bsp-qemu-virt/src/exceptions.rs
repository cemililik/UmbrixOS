//! Rust handlers called by the aarch64 vector trampolines in
//! `src/vectors.s`.
//!
//! Two entry points:
//!
//! - [`irq_entry`] — called from the IRQ trampoline at vector
//!   offset `+0x280` (Current EL with `SP_ELx`). Acknowledges the
//!   pending IRQ at the GIC, dispatches recognised IRQs to their
//!   handlers, signals end-of-interrupt, and returns to the
//!   trampoline which `eret`s back to the interrupted code.
//! - [`panic_entry`] — called from any of the unhandled-class
//!   trampolines (sync, FIQ, `SError` on any mode; IRQ on a
//!   non-`curr_el_spx` mode). Does not return — diverges into
//!   [`panic!`].
//!
//! See [`docs/architecture/exceptions.md`] §"Dispatch flow" for the
//! design. UNSAFE-2026-0020 covers the vector-table install + the
//! trampolines; the Rust functions here run with the GIC's CPU
//! interface in "active" state for the duration of `irq_entry`.
