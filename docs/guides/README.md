# Guides

Task-oriented walkthroughs for contributors and users of Tyrne. Guides answer *"how do I do X?"* — they are step-by-step, they assume little, and they link out to architecture and ADRs when background is needed.

## Status

Tyrne is in the architecture phase. Guides will be added as the corresponding implementation work is done. The list below is a placeholder so that folder structure and naming are clear.

## Planned guides

| Guide | Audience | Status |

| [`ci.md`](ci.md) | What the GitHub Actions pipeline runs, when it runs, and what each job gates. | Accepted (2026-04-23, R6) |

## Conventions

- Every guide starts with **Goal** and **Prerequisites** sections.
- Commands are shown in fenced code blocks with the shell language tag.
- File paths and command output are verbatim; placeholders use `<angle-brackets>`.
- When a guide is long, split it into numbered sub-steps and include a final **Verifying it worked** section.
