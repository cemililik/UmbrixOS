## User story

As the Umbrix kernel scheduler, I want a registered idle task and typed error variants for the two current kernel-liveness panics — so that a userspace-caused IPC graph with no runnable task cannot panic the kernel, and the resume-path `debug_assert!` in `ipc_recv_and_yield` becomes a release-mode typed return instead of a silent fall-through that the caller decodes as a panic one frame up.

## Context

The A5 scheduler shipped with three hard-panic paths documented in [ADR-0022](../../../decisions/0022-idle-task-and-typed-scheduler-deadlock.md):

1. `sched::ipc_recv_and_yield` panics with `"deadlock: all tasks blocked on IPC and no idle task available"` when every task is blocked and the ready queue is empty.
2. `sched::start` panics when called without any registered task.
3. A `debug_assert!(!matches!(result, Ok(RecvOutcome::Pending)))` in `ipc_recv_and_yield`'s resume path is stripped in release builds, allowing a `RecvOutcome::Pending` to propagate to the caller — where the BSP's `let RecvOutcome::Received { … } = outcome else { panic!(…) }` turns it into a downstream panic.

The 2026-04-21 Phase-A-exit security review flagged path (1) as §4 (liveness); the code review flagged all three. ADR-0022 resolves the design: idle-as-regular-task (Option A) + two new error surfaces (Option G: `SchedError::Deadlock` and `IpcError::PendingAfterResume`). Path (2)'s `start` empty-queue panic is **kept** — it is a boot-time programming error, not a runtime condition.

T-007 lands the implementation: register an idle task during `kernel_entry`, extend `SchedError` and `IpcError`, and wire the typed returns through `ipc_recv_and_yield`. Because ADR-0022 chose "idle as regular task", there is no new scheduler API — idle uses `sched::add_task` + `sched::yield_now` unchanged.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] **ADR-0022 Accepted** (2026-04-22) — idle-as-regular-task + typed `SchedError::Deadlock` + `IpcError::PendingAfterResume`; `start`'s empty-queue panic kept.
- [x] **`SchedError::Deadlock` variant added** to `kernel::sched::SchedError` and returned by `ipc_recv_and_yield` in place of the former `panic!("deadlock: …")`; scheduler state is restored before the return. Commit `029d066`.
- [x] **`IpcError::PendingAfterResume` variant added** to `kernel::ipc::IpcError` and returned through `SchedError::Ipc(…)` in place of the former release-mode fall-through. The companion `debug_assert!` is removed per the ADR-0022 *Revision notes* second rider — the typed return is the observable contract. Commit `029d066` (variant) / `8110cc5` (assert removal).
- [x] **BSP idle task registered.** `bsp-qemu-virt/src/main.rs` adds `TASK_IDLE_STACK`, `fn idle_entry() -> !`, and a `create_task` + `add_task` for idle in `kernel_entry` *after* A and B so FIFO dispatch still runs task B first. Idle body is `spin_loop + yield_now` for v1 (WFI deferred to T-009 per ADR-0022 first rider — no IRQ source yet). Commit `25cfaf4`.
- [x] **Tests:** `ipc_recv_and_yield_returns_deadlock_when_ready_queue_empty` (blocks sole task, asserts `Err(SchedError::Deadlock)`, verifies state restored) and `ipc_recv_and_yield_resume_pending_returns_typed_err` (uses a `ResetQueuesCpu` test-helper to force `Ok(Pending)` resume, asserts typed `Err`). Commit `8110cc5`.
- [x] **Tests stay green.** 77 kernel + 34 test-hal = 111 host tests (+2 from T-007). QEMU smoke reproduces the A6 five-line trace byte-for-byte.
- [x] **No new `unsafe` blocks introduced.** Idle reuses the existing `TaskStack` + `fn() -> !` + raw-pointer-bridge patterns; `ResetQueuesCpu`'s `Send`/`Sync` impls are test-only and scoped to the test module.
- [x] **Documentation:** `ipc_recv_and_yield`'s `# Errors` section documents `SchedError::Deadlock` and `SchedError::Ipc(IpcError::PendingAfterResume)`; `IpcError::PendingAfterResume` and `SchedError::Deadlock` carry inline doc-comments citing ADR-0022; the scheduler module doc gained an *Idle task* section. `idle_entry` documents the WFI deferral.

## Out of scope

- Idle task priority / per-priority queues — priorities are not on the B0/B1 roadmap (ADR-0019); idle-as-lowest-priority is a follow-up ADR if priorities land later.
- Kernel-owned idle entry function (Option D in ADR-0022) — explicitly rejected; BSPs own their idle entry.
- Timer IRQ wiring that would let idle wake up on tick — T-009.
- `const { assert!(N > 0) }` on `SchedQueue::new` / `CapabilityTable::new` — routed to T-010's hardening bundle unless it falls out naturally from this work.
- `TASK_ARENA_CAPACITY` bump — not needed; 16 minus idle = 15 is plenty for v1.
- Any code outside `kernel/src/sched/mod.rs`, `kernel/src/ipc/mod.rs`, `bsp-qemu-virt/src/main.rs`, and the audit log / docs it touches.

## Approach

Settled in ADR-0022 §Decision outcome. At sketch level, in commit order:

1. **Extend `IpcError` with `PendingAfterResume`.** One-line variant addition plus doc.
2. **Extend `SchedError` with `Deadlock`.** One-line variant addition plus doc; keep the existing `Ipc(IpcError)` variant — `PendingAfterResume` propagates through it.
3. **Rewire `ipc_recv_and_yield`:**
   - Replace the `panic!("deadlock: …")` in the Phase 2 block with `return Err(SchedError::Deadlock)` — and restore `s.current` + `s.task_states[current_idx]` to their pre-block state before returning so the caller is not left in an inconsistent scheduler state.
   - In Phase 3 (resume), replace the `debug_assert!` + `result.map_err(SchedError::Ipc)` pattern with an explicit match that converts `Ok(RecvOutcome::Pending)` into `Err(SchedError::Ipc(IpcError::PendingAfterResume))`. Keep the `debug_assert!` as a test-mode complement so the invariant is still loudly violated in debug builds.
4. **BSP idle registration.**
   - Add `static TASK_IDLE_STACK: TaskStack = TaskStack::new();` next to the existing stacks.
   - Add `fn idle_entry() -> !` that loops `cpu.wait_for_interrupt()` then `sched::yield_now(SCHED.as_mut_ptr(), cpu)`; `expect`s the `yield_now` Result since it can only error with `NoCurrentTask` (impossible once scheduler has started).
   - In `kernel_entry`: `create_task` for idle (before A and B so its handle is lowest-numbered), then `add_task` on the scheduler *before* the existing `add_task(B)` and `add_task(A)` — this keeps B as the first-dispatched task, matching the A6 trace.
5. **Tests.**
   - `sched::tests::deadlock_returns_err_when_no_idle` — builds a `Scheduler<FakeCpu>`, adds one task, blocks it on an endpoint via the bridge, asserts `SchedError::Deadlock`. Requires a test-only path through `ipc_recv_and_yield` that exercises the empty-ready-queue branch with `FakeCpu::context_switch` never actually being called.
   - `sched::tests::pending_after_resume_returns_err` — constructs the scheduler, drives a resume path where the endpoint state is forced to stay `Pending`, asserts `SchedError::Ipc(IpcError::PendingAfterResume)`.
   - Both tests must not require a real QEMU boot — they run in `cargo host-test`.
6. **QEMU smoke.** Boot under QEMU, capture the five-line trace, confirm byte-for-byte match with the A6 baseline.
7. **Task status → In Review**, `current.md` updated, commit sequence matches the projected list in §Design notes.

## Definition of done

- [x] `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- [x] `cargo host-clippy` clean with `-D warnings`.

- [x] Task status updated to `In Review`; [`docs/roadmap/current.md`](../../../roadmap/current.md) updated.

## Design notes

- **Why restore state before returning `Err(SchedError::Deadlock)`?** The current `panic!` path leaves `s.current = None` and `s.task_states[current_idx] = Blocked { on: ep_handle }` because it never returns. A typed return that *doesn't* restore these leaves the caller's scheduler view inconsistent with the task's actual state (the task is still running — it's the one that just observed the `Err`). The restore block is small (one line for `current`, one for `task_states`), and it keeps the bridge's invariants composable: after `Err(Deadlock)` the scheduler state is exactly what it was before the bridge was called. The test asserts this directly.
- **Why two variants across two enums instead of one?** ADR-0022 §Option G weighs this. Short form: scheduler faults live in `SchedError`; IPC faults live in `IpcError`. `PendingAfterResume` is semantically an IPC invariant ("sender failed to deliver before unblocking receiver"); it propagates through `SchedError::Ipc(…)` exactly like `IpcError::InvalidCapability` does today.
- **Why is `start`'s empty-queue panic kept?** Boot-time programming error. The only way to reach it is `kernel_entry` that forgot to `add_task`. Converting to `Err` means `kernel_entry` has to panic one frame up instead — strictly more code and less informative. Panicking where the invariant is violated is correct.
- **Idle registration order matters.** `add_task(idle)` must come before `add_task(B)` and `add_task(A)` so idle is in slot 0 of the ready queue but gets dequeued last. Actually the opposite — FIFO means the first-added runs first. So idle must be added **last** so B still runs first. Re-reading the approach: adding idle *after* A/B ensures B is dequeued first. Confirm on implementation; the test `yield_now_switches_context_and_updates_current` style test in sched/mod.rs is the reference for order.
- **Idle-yields-to-itself path.** When idle is the only ready task, its `yield_now` call observes the "only one ready task" early-return (`sched/mod.rs` line 385-389-ish in the current `yield_now`). The idle loop therefore degrades to a tight WFI loop — `wfi` → `yield_now` returns immediately → `wfi` again — with no context switch. Matches ADR-0022 §Option A's efficiency claim.
- **Projected commit sequence.**
  1. `docs(roadmap): open T-007 — idle task + typed scheduler deadlock (B0)` (this opening commit — task file + current.md + phase-b/README.md + phase-b.md + ADR-0022 accept).
  2. `feat(sched,ipc): SchedError::Deadlock + IpcError::PendingAfterResume; wire typed returns (T-007)`.
  3. `feat(bsp): register idle task in kernel_entry (T-007)`.
  4. `test(sched): deadlock and pending-after-resume return Err (T-007)`.
  5. `docs(roadmap): T-007 → In Review`.
