# Current focus

A short pointer file updated as work progresses. For the full plan see [`phases/`](phases/); for the process see [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-roadmap-and-planning.md).

---

- **Active phase:** A — Kernel core on QEMU `virt`.
- **Active milestone:** A4 — IPC primitives.
- **Active task:** [T-003 — IPC primitives](../analysis/tasks/phase-a/T-003-ipc-primitives.md) (status: **Draft** — blocked on ADR-0017; propose ADR-0017 to unblock).
- **Working branch:** `development`.
- **Last completed milestone:** A3 — Kernel objects, on 2026-04-21 (PR merged to `main`).
- **Last completed task:** [T-002 — Kernel object storage foundation](../analysis/tasks/phase-a/T-002-kernel-object-storage.md) — `Done` 2026-04-21.
- **Last review:** [A2 completion business review](../analysis/reviews/business-reviews/2026-04-21-A2-completion.md) — 2026-04-21.
- **Next review trigger:** code + security review of T-003's implementation when it reaches `In Review`; business review waits for A6 per [phase-a.md closure](phases/phase-a.md).

## Notes

- The capability subsystem (T-001), kernel-object subsystem (T-002), and IPC-primitive subsystem (T-003) form the Phase A stack. T-001 and T-002 both shipped with zero `unsafe` and no heap. Neither subsystem is wired into `run` yet; that is Phase-A later-milestone work.
- [ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-capability-representation.md) and [ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-kernel-object-storage.md) both Accepted.
- T-002 introduced `obj::{Arena, Task, Endpoint, Notification}` with typed handles and rewired `CapObject` to a typed enum paralleling `CapKind`. `Capability::new` lost its redundant `kind` parameter (kind is now derived from the object's variant). 44 host tests green (kernel crate).
- T-003 is Draft pending ADR-0017 (IPC primitive set). ADR-0017 settles rendezvous semantics, message format, and the `reply_recv` fastpath question before any implementation code lands.
- The maintainer updates this file when the active task changes. AI agents update it when they move a task to `In Progress` or `Done` via the [`start-task`](../../.claude/skills/start-task/SKILL.md) and [`conduct-review`](../../.claude/skills/conduct-review/SKILL.md) skills.
