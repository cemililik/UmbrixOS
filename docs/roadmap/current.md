# Current focus

A short pointer file updated as work progresses. For the full plan see [`phases/`](phases/); for the process see [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-roadmap-and-planning.md).

---

- **Active phase:** A — Kernel core on QEMU `virt`.
- **Active milestone:** A3 — Kernel objects.
- **Active task:** [T-002 — Kernel object storage foundation](../analysis/tasks/phase-a/T-002-kernel-object-storage.md) (status: **Ready** — advancing to `In Progress` with the first implementation commit).
- **Working branch:** `development`.
- **Last completed milestone:** A2 — Capability table foundation, on 2026-04-21 (PR #1 merged to `main`).
- **Last completed task:** [T-001 — Capability table foundation](../analysis/tasks/phase-a/T-001-capability-table-foundation.md) — `Done` 2026-04-21.
- **Last review:** [A2 completion business review](../analysis/reviews/business-reviews/2026-04-21-A2-completion.md) — 2026-04-21.
- **Next review trigger:** code + security review of T-002's implementation when it reaches `In Review`; business review waits for A6 per [phase-a.md closure](phases/phase-a.md).

## Notes

- The capability subsystem shipped in T-001: `cap::CapabilityTable`, `cap::CapHandle`, `cap::CapRights`, `cap::Capability`, `cap::CapError`, with zero `unsafe` and no heap. The module is not yet wired into `run`.
- [ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-capability-representation.md) and [ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-kernel-object-storage.md) both Accepted; T-002 implementation may begin.
- The maintainer updates this file when the active task changes. AI agents update it when they move a task to `In Progress` or `Done` via the [`start-task`](../../.claude/skills/start-task/SKILL.md) and [`conduct-review`](../../.claude/skills/conduct-review/SKILL.md) skills.
