# NNNN — <Title>

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Deciders:** @cemililik

## Context

<What is the situation, the problem, or the question? What constraints apply? What are the stakes of getting this wrong?>

## Decision drivers

- <Driver 1 — what force pushes us toward one answer or away from another?>
- <Driver 2>
- <Driver 3>

## Considered options

1. **<Option A>** — one-sentence description.
2. **<Option B>** — one-sentence description.
3. **<Option C>** — one-sentence description.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: **<Option X>**.

<Why this one. Usually a paragraph or two connecting the decision drivers to the chosen option.>

### Dependency chain

<List every task / piece of infrastructure / prior decision that must already
exist for this ADR's chosen option to be **fully** in effect, in
implementation order. Each line either points at an existing T-NNN file or
flags it as a gap that must be opened before the ADR claims its full benefit.
This subsection exists to prevent the failure mode the A → B0 arc rediscovered
four times: an ADR's "future task X will do Y" handwave going unverified until
implementation surfaces the gap (see ADR-0025 §Rule 1 (forward-reference contract)).>

Example (placeholders only — replace with the real T-NNNs your decision names):
```text
For this decision to be fully in effect:
1. <Subsystem A read path> — T-NNN (Status)
2. <Subsystem B programming step> — T-NNN (Status)
3. <Driver C configuration> — T-NNN
4. <Vector D install> — T-NNN

The first task closes only step 1. Remaining steps are scoped under
the second task, opened in the same commit as this ADR if it does
not yet exist.
```

If a step has no T-NNN slot, the ADR cannot Accept until one is opened (per
ADR-0025 §Rule 1 (forward-reference contract)).

## Consequences

### Positive

- <Benefit 1>
- <Benefit 2>

### Negative

- <Cost or risk 1 — and how we plan to live with or mitigate it>
- <Cost or risk 2>

### Neutral

- <Side effect that is neither a clear benefit nor a clear cost>
